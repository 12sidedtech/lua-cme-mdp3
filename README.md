# 12Sided Capture Environment - CME MDP 3.0

This example shows how to use the 12Sided Capture Environment's Lua packet processing API to:

 1. Consume packets from the inbound packet queue
 2. Handle the payload/contents of the message
 3. Act on the contents to update state
 4. Pass a summary message on to the output message queue.

This example is not necessarily fit for production use, since it has not been sufficiently
thoroughly tested. Rather, this is solely intended to act as a demonstration of the various
components of the Lua packet processing API.
